### Installing the ZENCash Desktop GUI Wallet on Linux

To setup the APT repository and install packages, using a terminal run the following commands 
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https lsb-release

echo 'deb https://zencashofficial.github.io/repo/ '$(lsb_release -cs)' main' | sudo tee --append /etc/apt/sources.list.d/zen.list
gpg --keyserver ha.pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv 219F55740BBF7A1CE368BA45FB7053CE4991B669
gpg --export 219F55740BBF7A1CE368BA45FB7053CE4991B669 | sudo apt-key add -

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install zen zencash-desktop-gui-wallet
```
Then you need to set up the `zen.conf` configuration file:
```
mkdir -p ~/.zen
echo "rpcuser=username" >> ~/.zen/zen.conf
echo "rpcpassword=$(head -c 32 /dev/urandom | base64)" >> ~/.zen/zen.conf
```

Finally you need to download the Z cryptographic keys (takes a while):
```
zen-fetch-params
```

### Known issues and limitations
1. Limitation: if two users exchange text messages via the messaging UI TAB and one of them has a system clock, substantially running slow or fast by more than 1 minute, it is possible that this user will see text messages appearing out of order. 
1. Limitation: if a messaging identity has been created (happens on first click on the messaging UI tab), then replacing the `wallet.dat` or changing the node configuration between mainnet and testnet will make the identity invalid. This will result in a wallet update error. To remove the error the directory `~/.ZENCashSwingWalletUI/messaging` may be manually renamed or deleted (when the wallet is stopped). **CAUTION: all messaging history will be lost in this case!**
1. Limitation: Wallet encryption has been temporarily disabled in ZENCash due to stability problems. A corresponding issue 
[#1552](https://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/1552) has been opened by the ZCash developers. Correspondingly
wallet encryption has been temporarily disabled in the ZENCash Desktop GUI Wallet.
1. Issue: GUI data tables (transactions/addresses etc.) allow copying of data via double click but also allow editing. 
The latter needs to be disabled. 
1. Limitation: The list of transactions does not show all outgoing ones (specifically outgoing Z address 
transactions). A corresponding issue [#1438](https://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/1438) has been opened 
for the ZCash developers. 
1. Limitation: The CPU percentage shown to be taken by zend on Linux is the average for the entire lifetime 
of the process. This is not very useful. This will be improved in future versions.
